  <h1> Meet The Artist  </h1>

<div class="flavortxt">
  <p>When I transferred into San Jos√© State University, I confidently knew that I was entering the last lap of my educational career.
  I have been taking studio art classes at Foothill college while I figured out what aspect of art I felt the most passionate about. <br>
  My creative passion for world-building and character design flourished as I polished my skills in illustration and painting
  (See: <i> Potions </i>, 2021; <i>Filipinwho</i>, 2021). Then I began taking animation classes at De Anza college
  and worked on one of the largest projects of my educational career, Kanye Quest (Trailer), where I learned how to utilize different animation programs and challenged my skill set to visualize the extent of my creativity. <br>
  I wish to continue sharing visualizations of my dreams and learn more about creating simulations like video games with the help of the BFA program.
  My understanding of 3D design and UX/UI design exist on a surface level, but learning the basics will help me explore those areas creatively.
  Working under major social media industries is how I envision myself as a multimedia content designer once I graduate from the program. <br>
  One day I dream of introducing media that allows me to share my personal identity and encourage cultural diversity. <br>
